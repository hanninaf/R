##i.	Farmers needs help forecasting the milk production of their cows. Since machinery, for milking, is quite expensive, 
##he needs to know if the amount of machines he has are enough for the amount of milk his cows are producing.

Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
